      The faithful segregation of genetic material during cell division is an absolute prerequisite for life's continuity. 
                    At the heart of this intricate process lies a sophisticated machinery of molecules that capture, protect, and release chromosomes with exquisite timing. 
                    This presentation delves into the roles of these key players.

        To facilitate chromosome condensation, most Cohesin is removed from chromosome arms during prophase. This process is driven by the

        The Secret Weapon of Meiosis I
       </h4>
       <p class="text-lg">
        For homologous chromosomes to segregate while sister chromatids remain joined, centromeric cohesion must be preserved during Anaphase I. This crucial task is performed by

         Shugoshin (SGO1, Japanese for 'guardian spirit')

        Molecular Mechanism of Action

        SGO1 protects centromeric Cohesin by recruiting the phosphatase

         PP2A
        </strong>
        . PP2A removes phosphates from the meiotic Cohesin subunit Rec8, thereby preventing Separase from recognizing and cleaving it. This ensures that only Cohesin on the chromosome arms is cleaved in Anaphase I, allowing homologs to separate while sisters stay firmly connected at their centromeres.
